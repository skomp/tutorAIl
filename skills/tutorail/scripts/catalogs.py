"""Fetch, cache and merge the learner's tutorial catalogues.

RUNTIME script. Unlike validate_bundle.py, this one runs on a learner's
machine, so it uses the standard library and the `git` binary and nothing
else. No third-party packages, no network client of its own, no credential
handling: `git` borrows whatever access the user already granted it.

Usage:
    catalogs.py discover            refresh every catalogue, print the merged
                                    catalogue and the per-catalogue status
    catalogs.py status              print the per-catalogue status from what
                                    is already on disk; fetch nothing
    catalogs.py resolve <id>        print one merged entry and the bundle
                                    directory it resolves to; fetch nothing
    catalogs.py covers <query>      print the bundles that TEACH a concept
    catalogs.py follow-ups <id>     print what could be taken after a bundle
    catalogs.py prepare <id>        print what covers the concepts a bundle
                                    assumes

The last three fetch nothing either, unless given --refresh.

Options:
    --config PATH       the catalogue of catalogues
                        (default ~/.config/tutorail/catalogs.yaml)
    --cache-dir PATH    (default ~/.cache/tutorail)
    --timeout SECONDS   per git command (default 30)
    --offline           discover without fetching; serve what is on disk
    --json              machine-readable output instead of the report

Exit codes:
    0  every configured catalogue answered
    1  at least one catalogue was served from cache or could not be served,
       and at least one entry is available
    2  usage, or the catalogue of catalogues is unusable
    3  no entry could be served at all

Three rules this script exists to keep:

  * **Discovery loads metadata only.** Nothing here opens, stats or lists
    anything under a tutorial's bundle path. `discover` cannot tell whether a
    bundle is present, and must not: that is what keeps a remote catalogue
    possible. Only `resolve`, which runs after the learner has chosen, looks
    at a bundle directory.

  * **A failed refresh never fails discovery.** The catalogues that answered
    are served, the one that did not is named, and its last successful copy
    is used and marked as cached. Stale results are never presented as
    current: every catalogue is reported with the timestamp of its last
    successful refresh.

  * **Covering is not assuming.** `covers` says what a bundle teaches;
    `assumes` says what it expects you to bring. A concept query reads
    `covers` and never `assumes`, because a bundle that assumes a concept
    starts where a learner asking about it is stuck. Every result carries
    the route it arrived by, and an inferred relation is never shown as
    something an author recommended.

  * **Failures are not collapsed.** "The host is unreachable", "you have no
    access to this repository" and "this repository has no catalogue file"
    have three different repairs. A git failure this script cannot recognise
    is reported as unclassified with git's own words, never guessed into one
    of the three.

    No filesystem call, because this runs during discovery, which must not
    touch anything under a bundle path. `os.path.normpath` collapses the
    '..' segments textually, which is what the check needs. Symlinks are
    deliberately not resolved, for the same reason.

    `root` is an anchor with no parent. A bundle path may descend into it,
    and may leave a directory and return inside it, but it may not step out
    of it - not even when the filesystem would clamp the step, which is why
    the answer cannot depend on where the root is. The parameter stays
    because it names what the path is measured against, and because
    `validate_bundle` check 7 and the discovery guard below both read
    better for passing it.

    Earlier versions compared strings: `normpath(join(root, relative))`
    against `str(root)`, and against `str(root) + os.sep`. That is the
    right question only for a root with at least one component and no
    trailing separator, and it failed in BOTH directions for the rest:

      * `Path(".")` - `normpath("./bundle")` is `"bundle"`, which shares no
        prefix with `"."`, so every contained path read as an escape.
        Issue #14, worked around on the validator's side by anchoring the
        root with `os.path.abspath` in `validate_bundle.catalog_root()`.
      * `Path("/")` - `str(root) + os.sep` is `"//"`, and no normalised
        path starts with that, so again every contained path read as an
        escape. Issue #16.
      * `Path("..")` - the dangerous direction. `normpath("../../outside")`
        does start with `"../"`, so a path that really does leave read as
        contained.

    `normpath` leaves every surviving '..' at the front of the path, with
    nothing left in front of it to cancel it. So one '..' component in the
    normalised form is exactly the escape, for every root, with no string
    prefix left to get wrong.

# Relationships: concepts, recommendations, and the reverse index
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Four optional catalogue fields carry this: `covers`, `assumes`,
# `recommended_follow_ups` and `recommended_previous_bundles`. They are
# entry-level metadata for the same reason `subjects` is: discovery loads
# metadata only, and a bundle's own tutorial.yaml may not even be on this
# machine yet.
#
# Three rules this section exists to keep, each of which is easy to break by
# accident and impossible to notice afterwards:
#
#   * **A query for bundles COVERING a concept searches `covers`, never
#     `assumes`.** A bundle that assumes retained-event-logs does not teach
#     it, and returning it as though it did sends a learner to a course that
#     starts where they are stuck.
#
#   * **Provenance is kept, never flattened.** Every result says which route
#     it arrived by, and a bundle that arrives by several routes keeps all of
#     them. An inferred relation is NEVER presented as an author
#     recommendation; the two are rendered in separate sections and carry a
#     separate flag in the JSON.
#
#   * **The reverse index is the point.** A third party publishes a follow-up
#     to someone else's bundle by naming it in
#     `recommended_previous_bundles`, without touching the original. So
#     follow-up discovery reads that field BACKWARDS, across every configured
#     catalogue, and the original author never has to know.
#
# No semantic-search service is required, or used. The ranking ladder in the
# design ends with an optional semantic tier "only if the architecture
# already has it"; this architecture does not have one, so that tier is never
# produced. Everything below is exact string work on normalised text, which
# means the same catalogues always give the same answer.

# 1 exact concept id, 2 exact per-concept alias, 3 normalised text,
# 4 a recommended previous bundle THAT COVERS THE CONCEPT, 5 broad subject;
# that is the design's ladder, and tier 6, semantic, is never produced. A
# relationship query ranks the author's own list first, the reverse-declared
# list second and the inferred relatives third.
