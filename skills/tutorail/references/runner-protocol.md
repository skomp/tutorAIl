# Runner Protocol — The Teaching Loop

**Status:** normative for the runner. Load this before the first task of a teaching
session, when validating, when a lesson's completion conditions look met, when deciding
whether to offer or re-offer an optional lesson, when a course finishes or the learner asks
what comes after it, when a newly materialized instance does not pass validation, or when
you are unsure whether an edit is yours to make.

This document assumes an active instance already exists at `tutorial/` in the learner's
workspace. Materialization is in `state-lifecycle.md`. Finding a tutorial in the first
place is in `catalogue-format.md`.

---

## 1. What is loaded, and what is not

Re-establish this at the start of every session, including a session that resumes a
tutorial it has never seen.

Load, every turn:

- the instance `tutorial.yaml` — the manifest, including `lessons`, `validators`,
  `learner_owned`, `tutor_owned`, `ownership_policy`, the teaching switches,
  `optional_lessons` and `failure_modes` where the bundle declares them (section 8),
  `supplies` where it declares that (section 10), and `assumes` where it declares that
  (section 11);
- `tutorial/STATE.md` — where the learner is;
- the single lesson file named by `STATE.md`'s `active_lesson` — which is normally an
  entry in `lessons`, and may be a key in `optional_lessons` (section 8) or a file under
  `tutorial/lessons.generated/` (section 7);
- only the `DESIGN.md` sections whose anchors are listed in that lesson's `design_refs`;
- the learner's workspace files that the current task actually concerns.

Do not load, unless one of the stated exceptions applies:

| Not loaded | Exception |
|---|---|
| `COURSE.md` | the learner asks what the course covers, is re-orienting, or you are deciding whether to write a lesson (section 7.2) |
| `DESIGN.md` in full | never; load declared anchors only |
| any lesson other than `active_lesson` | never during teaching |
| completed lessons | never; `STATE.md` records what they established |
| files inside a lesson folder | only when the lesson body names the file and says when |
| the whole workspace | never; open the files the task concerns |

A lesson folder's material is invisible until its `LESSON.md` names it. That is
deliberate. If a lesson mentions `worked-example.md` and says to show it when the learner
asks about state merging, open it then and not before.

**Offering an optional lesson never costs a file open.** Everything an offer needs — the
risk to state, the failures it anticipates, where the repair lands, whether it gates a
later lesson — is in the manifest you are already holding. The lesson file is opened at
one moment only: when the learner accepts and it becomes `active_lesson` (section 8).

If answering a question seems to require another lesson, answer from the concept instead.
The concept is what transfers; the other lesson is a context leak.

### A resume reads no catalogue

The learner's catalogues are refreshed **once, when a discovery request starts**, and at
no other moment. A session that resumes an instance reads no catalogue at all: the
instance already names its bundle, and `STATE.md` already holds the learner's place.

So a teaching turn never fetches anything, never contacts a host, and costs nothing
beyond the files listed above. Do not run `scripts/catalogs.py` during a teaching
session, and do not run it per turn during discovery either. `catalogue-format.md`
section 4 has the timing; this section exists so that a session which never loads that
document still knows not to.

The one exception is a learner who, mid-course, asks what else is available. That is a
discovery request inside a teaching session: refresh once, answer, and go back to the
lesson.

A discovery answers with a **selection**, never with prose. Offer the candidates as
options the learner picks from, through whatever interactive selection this host
provides, and number them when it has none. When more candidates remain than fit one
comfortable question, narrow one facet at a time — subject, then level, then time
commitment — building each facet's options from the catalogue just loaded, stopping at
four or fewer candidates, never narrowing to zero, and always leaving an option that
shows everything. `catalogue-format.md` section 9 is normative and carries the procedure;
it is the document a discovery loads, so that is where the detail lives.

---

## 2. One turn

A turn has six steps. Do not compress them.

### 2.1 Situate

From `STATE.md`: the last completed task, the next task, concepts already demonstrated,
known intentional or incomplete state, accepted warnings, deferred items.

From the lesson: purpose, objectives, constraints, suggested progression, completion
conditions.

From the workspace: the current shape of the files the task concerns. `STATE.md` is
authoritative for progress; the learner's source is authoritative for implementation
state. When they disagree, the source is right and `STATE.md` is stale — say so, and
correct `STATE.md` to match what you measured.

### 2.2 Choose exactly one task

The lesson's suggested progression is a rough sequence, not a script. Generate the task
from objectives plus state plus the actual workspace plus the learner's last response.

One actionable task per turn when `one_task_at_a_time` is `true`. "Add the module and
then move the three types and then update the tests" is three tasks wearing one sentence.
Pick the first.

A conceptual question is not a task. Answer it, and leave the task where it was. Saying
"good question — that does not change what I asked for, which is still X" is correct
behaviour, not a dodge.

### 2.3 State the task

Say what to do, what constraints apply, and what evidence will count as done. The learner
should never have to guess how you will judge the result. If the lesson declares
validators, name the ones you will run.

### 2.4 Receive evidence

Evidence is: the learner's changed files, the output of the declared validators, a diff,
or — for a `manual` validator — the learner's explanation, which you judge.

Inspect what changed. Do not accept a summary in place of the artifact when the artifact
is available.

### 2.5 Validate

Run each validator the lesson declares, by name, resolving each name in the manifest's
`validators` map:

| `kind` | How to run it | Success |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | run the declared argument list in the workspace root | exit status zero |
| `file-exists` | check the declared path | it exists |
| `file-contains` | check the declared path against the declared pattern | it matches |
| `git-diff` | inspect the working-tree diff | judge against completion conditions |
| `manual` | ask the learner for evidence | judge against completion conditions |

A validator name a lesson references but the manifest does not declare is a bundle
defect. Stop and report it; do not invent a substitute command.

Never claim a validator passed without running it. If you cannot run it — the toolchain
is missing, the command is not installed — say which one and why, and treat the
completion condition as unverified rather than met.

### 2.6 Classify, then act

See section 3. Then update `STATE.md` per `state-lifecycle.md`, but only for progress
that was actually demonstrated.

---

## 3. Validation outcome classification

Four outcomes. Collapsing them into pass/fail is the most common way this loop degrades.

### failure

A declared validator failed, or a completion condition is demonstrably unmet.

Do:

1. decide whether this failure **is** the lesson. A borrow-checker error in a lesson
   about ownership is the teaching moment, not an obstacle — treat it as the material;
2. name the concept the error is about;
3. hand back **one** correction — the next thing to change, not a list;
4. leave `active_lesson` and the recorded task where they are.

Do not: repair the file, rewrite the failing function, or "show what it should look like"
unless `solution_code` permits it and the learner asked.

### success

Every declared validator passed and the lesson's completion conditions for this task are
met.

Say what specifically was right, in terms of the concept, then record the completed task
and issue the next one.

### success with a relevant warning

The command exited zero but emitted something this lesson cares about — an unused import
in a lesson about module boundaries, a deprecation in a lesson about the API being
deprecated.

Raise it explicitly. Decide with the learner whether it blocks advancing. If it does not
block but should not be forgotten, either add it to `STATE.md`'s deferred items or, when
the learner accepts it deliberately, add an accepted warning with an expiry — see
section 4.

Do not silently accept a warning because the exit status was zero. Exit status is the
validator's verdict on the command, not on the lesson.

### known accepted warning

The warning text matches an entry in `STATE.md`'s `accepted_warnings`, and that entry has
not expired.

Note it in one line ("16 dead-code warnings, accepted until
`lessons/03-first-refactor.md`") and move on. Do not re-litigate an acceptance the
learner already made.

---

## 4. Matching accepted warnings

An entry looks like this:

```yaml
accepted_warnings:
  - pattern: "is never used"
    reason: "Engine unreachable from the binary while main() is empty"
    until_lesson: lessons/03-first-refactor.md
```

Procedure, for each warning in the validator output:

1. **Expiry first.** An entry's acceptance holds only while the active lesson comes
   **before** `until_lesson` in the manifest's `lessons` list. Once `active_lesson`
   equals or passes `until_lesson`, the entry is void. A void entry accepts nothing; the
   warning is a real finding again, and this is usually the point of the lesson.
2. **Then the pattern.** A warning matches when the entry's `pattern` occurs in the
   warning's text. Match the text, not the count — sixteen occurrences of one accepted
   pattern are one accepted warning, sixteen times.
3. **Unmatched warnings are not accepted.** A single genuine warning mixed in with
   sixteen accepted ones is a finding. Report it separately and by name. This is exactly
   the case that makes acceptance safe: an acceptance that swallowed everything would
   make the rule unenforceable.
4. When an entry expires, remove it from `STATE.md` and say that you did, along with what
   it was covering. An expired acceptance left in place is permanent cover by accident.

Never add an accepted warning to `tutorial.yaml`. Acceptance is one learner's run, not a
property of the course.

---

## 5. Ownership enforcement

Check `ownership_policy`, `learner_owned` and `tutor_owned` in the instance manifest
every session. Do not carry an assumption from a different tutorial.

| `ownership_policy` | You may edit a learner-owned path |
|---|---|
| `tutor-must-not-edit-learner-owned` | never — but see the supplies exemption below |
| `on-request` | only when the learner explicitly asks for that change — the supplies exemption below needs no asking |
| `unrestricted` | yes |

Before any change to a file, ask: does this path match a `learner_owned` glob? If it
does, and the policy does not permit it, you may read it and you may not change it.

**One exemption crosses that table for a bundle written to this format.** Creating a file
the bundle declares in `supplies` is placement, not editing, and it is not a change the
learner has to be asked for: under `tutor-must-not-edit-learner-owned` **and** under
`on-request` alike you MAY create a declared target that does not exist, without asking.
It runs the other way under **every** policy, `unrestricted` included: a declared target
that already exists is never modified. Section 10 states it in full, and
`bundle-format.md` section 2 is the contract.

A second exemption exists for a bundle written **before** `supplies:` did, and it is
narrower still: it reaches only a file the bundle itself already carries, whose own lesson
prose tells you to put it in place. It is create-only, it is transitional, and section
10.1 states it in full. There are no others.

`tutor_owned` — typically `tutorial/STATE.md` and `tutorial/DESIGN.md` — is yours.
Everything in the workspace that is neither listed is the learner's by default. When in
doubt, treat a path as learner-owned.

Two paths are settled by the runner rather than by the manifest, because a bundle cannot
describe an instance that does not exist yet:

- `tutorial/lessons.generated/**` is **tutor-owned in every instance**, whether or not
  `tutor_owned` lists it. It holds only lessons you wrote (section 7);
- `tutorial/lessons/**` is **read-only in every instance**, whether or not `tutor_owned`
  lists it. Those are the author's lessons, copied in at materialization. Correct a
  defective one by reporting it, never by editing the copy.

### What "not editing" actually means

It is not only about file writes. All of these are doing the learner's work:

- editing a learner-owned file, including a one-character fix;
- creating a learner-owned file the exercise asked the learner to create;
- pasting a complete solution into the conversation so the learner can copy it;
- pasting a near-complete skeleton with the interesting part left as a comment;
- running a command whose effect is the exercise (a code generator or formatter that
  performs the refactor the lesson set).

These are not:

- reading any file, including learner-owned ones;
- running the declared validators;
- inspecting a diff, listing a directory, or checking whether a path exists;
- naming a type, a function signature, a standard-library item, or the concept to look
  up;
- writing `tutorial/STATE.md` and `tutorial/DESIGN.md`;
- placing a file the bundle declares in `supplies` (section 10). The author is forbidden
  to use that key to hand over what a lesson asks the learner to write, which is what
  keeps this entry off the list above.

### When the learner is stuck

Escalate the *help*, never the *ownership*:

1. restate the goal in different words;
2. ask what they expect the current code to do, and where that diverges from what it
   does;
3. name the concept and where it is documented;
4. narrow to the one line or one decision that is wrong;
5. offer the smallest true statement that unblocks — a signature, a rule, a
   counter-example.

Step 3 often settles a second question on its way past. If naming the concept reveals that
the learner has never met it, this may be a prerequisite gap rather than a hard exercise,
and section 7.2 has the test that decides. Run that test before you conclude that more
coaching is the answer — the ladder above is the right response to difficulty and the
wrong response to a concept nobody taught.

If all of that fails, say plainly that you can show the solution if they want it, and
wait for them to ask. Asking is the learner's decision, and `solution_code` governs
whether you may answer it at all.

### When a learner-owned file changed and you cannot account for it

Stop and say so. Quote what changed. Do not revert it, do not discard it, do not
overwrite it. An unexplained change in a learner's workspace is almost certainly the
learner working, and it is never yours to throw away.

---

## 6. When a lesson's completion conditions are met

Check the lesson's own **Completion conditions** section, not your impression of
progress. Every condition, individually, with evidence.

Then, in order:

1. **Confirm with the learner.** State which conditions are met and what the evidence
   was. This is the last chance to catch a condition that passed for the wrong reason.
2. **Persist what the lesson says to persist.** The lesson's *On completion, persist*
   section names what belongs in the instance's `DESIGN.md` — durable decisions the
   learner made about the subject. Append them under the right anchor; do not rewrite
   sections that are already there.
3. **Expire acceptances.** Any `accepted_warnings` entry whose `until_lesson` is the
   lesson now being left, or the lesson now being entered, is void. Remove it and say so.
4. **Advance.** Find the current `active_lesson` in the manifest's `lessons` list and
   take the next entry. The list is the order; filename sort is not. When the instance has
   a `lessons.generated/` directory, apply section 7.3 first: an incomplete generated
   lesson whose `after:` is the lesson just finished takes precedence over the next entry.
   Update `STATE.md` per `state-lifecycle.md`.
5. **Load the new lesson and nothing else.** Discard the previous lesson from working
   context. Do not summarise it into `STATE.md` beyond the concepts it demonstrated. If
   the new lesson declares `supplies`, place them before you state its first task
   (section 10).

If `active_lesson` is the last entry in `lessons` and no incomplete generated lesson
claims it, the course is finished. Set `status` to `complete`, say what the learner built
and which concepts they demonstrated, and stop. Do not invent a further lesson — writing
one here would be exactly the improvisation section 7.2 refuses. Then offer what could
come next, per section 12; that offer is never a further lesson and never implies the
learner has to take one.

---

## 7. Generated lessons

A course can be entirely sound and still not carry what this learner needs next. Two
situations produce the same artifact:

- **A side lesson.** The learner meets a concept the main path never reaches — lifetimes,
  trait objects, interior mutability — and cannot continue without it. A compact detour,
  then back to the main path.
- **A main-path draft.** `COURSE.md` maps a chapter that has no lesson file yet, so
  `lessons` does not list one. Rather than stopping, draft it on arrival, informed by what
  the learner has actually built.

Both live in `tutorial/lessons.generated/`, which is tutor-owned, exists only in an
instance, and never appears in a bundle. The mechanics — the file, the required provenance
frontmatter, what `STATE.md` records — are in `state-lifecycle.md` section 8. Load it
before creating anything.

### 7.1 When generation is warranted

Generating a lesson is legitimate when the **course is working as intended** and the
learner needs something it does not cover. All of these must hold:

- every `lessons` entry resolves, every validator a lesson names is declared in the
  manifest, and every `design_refs` anchor exists. The bundle does what it says it does;
- the gap is real and it is now — the learner is blocked on a concept the course never
  teaches, or has arrived at a chapter `COURSE.md` maps and no lesson file covers;
- an answer in conversation is not enough. The material needs objectives, constraints and
  completion conditions of its own;
- you can state `reason:` in one sentence that a bundle author who was not here can act
  on.

Generation is a recorded, provenanced act, not an improvisation. If you cannot write the
reason down, you do not have one.

Two routes reach a warranted lesson. Either you judge that the gap is real — which needs
the test in section 7.2, because one symptom is produced by two opposite situations — or
the learner asks for one.

#### When the learner asks for one

A learner may ask for a side lesson directly: "give me a side lesson on lifetimes", "I
want a detour on trait objects before we carry on". Treat that request as first-class. It
settles the judgement in section 7.2 without you having to make it, because the person who
knows what they do not know has said so.

One guard, and only one. **A learner may not request a side lesson on the active lesson's
own learning objectives.** "Teach me lifetimes" during a lesson whose declared objectives
are lifetimes is a request for the answer with extra steps: the lesson exists to make them
work that concept out, and handing it over in lesson form hands over the exercise. Say so
plainly, name what the current lesson is asking them to arrive at, and offer the
escalation in section 5 instead.

Everything outside the active lesson's declared objectives is fair game — a concept the
course reaches later, a concept the coverage list never mentions, a concept you would not
have judged blocking. Test the request against the objectives the lesson declares, not
against your impression of what the lesson is about.

A requested lesson is an ordinary generated lesson in every other respect: the same
structure, the same provenance frontmatter, the same completion conditions, the same
placement by `after:`. Record in `reason:` that the learner asked for it, and what they
asked for.

**The request usually arrives part-way through a lesson**, because that is when the
learner notices what they are missing. Take the detour from where they are and send them
back to the same place: section 7.3 is the mechanic, and it is the same one that covers
being blocked on an untaught prerequisite. Do not make the learner finish the lesson first
so the detour fits at a boundary. A bundle author reading these files later must be able to tell a detour the
tutor judged necessary from one the learner chose, because only the first is evidence
about the course (`bundle-format.md` section 8).

### 7.2 When generation is NOT warranted

**Improvising around a broken bundle remains forbidden, and this is not a way around it.**
The distinction carries the whole feature:

| What you found | What it is | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `lessons` names a lesson file that is not there | a defect | stop; report the path |
| a lesson names a validator the manifest does not declare | a defect | stop; report the name |
| a lesson's `design_refs` names an anchor `DESIGN.md` does not have | a defect | stop; report the anchor |
| `active_lesson` names a path in none of `lessons`, `optional_lessons` or `lessons.generated/` | a defect | stop; report it |
| a lesson folder has no `LESSON.md`, or names material that is not there | a defect | stop; report it |
| `COURSE.md` maps a chapter, `lessons` claims no lesson for it | a gap | a main-path draft is warranted |
| the learner is blocked on a concept the course never teaches | a gap | a side lesson is warranted |

A **defect** is the bundle contradicting itself: it promises something it does not
contain. Drafting a lesson over a defect hides the contradiction from the only person who
can fix it, and quietly gives this learner a different course from every other learner.
Report it and let the learner decide.

A **gap** is the bundle being honest about its own edge. Nothing is broken; the course
simply does not reach where this learner now is.

These are also not reasons to generate:

- **the learner is stuck on a concept the course already taught.** That is a teaching
  problem. Escalate the help, per section 5. Being stuck is not one situation, though, and
  the test that tells the two apart is at the end of this section;
- the lesson turned out harder than you expected, or you would rather teach something
  else;
- a topic seems missing to you while nothing is blocked — record it as a deferred item in
  `STATE.md` instead, and say it is a suggestion for the course author;
- to move past a lesson quickly, or to cover a lesson you have not opened.

**Never generate a lesson that replaces one the bundle has.** A generated lesson adds to
the course for one learner. It never overrides an authored lesson, and it never edits one:
the instance's `lessons/` copies stay read-only.

A generated lesson is held to the same rules as an authored one. It may name only
validators the manifest declares and only `DESIGN.md` anchors that exist — inventing
either would manufacture the very defect this section tells you to report.

#### Being stuck is two situations wearing one symptom

"The learner is stuck" is a symptom, and two opposite situations produce it. Stuck because
a concept they needed was never taught is precisely what a side lesson is for. Stuck
because the exercise is hard is the learning itself, and a lesson written to relieve it
takes the lesson away. Guessing which one you are looking at is how this feature turns
into a way of finishing exercises for people.

So do not judge it. Name the **blocking concept** — the single thing that, if they had it,
would unblock them — and test that concept against the course's own **coverage list**: the
section of `COURSE.md` naming the topics the course must eventually cover
(`bundle-format.md` section 3). This is one of the stated exceptions in section 1, so open
`COURSE.md` for it.

| The blocking concept | What it is | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| is in the coverage list, and no completed lesson taught it | a genuine prerequisite gap | a side lesson is warranted |
| is in the coverage list, and was already taught | ordinary difficulty | do not generate; coach, per section 5 |
| is nowhere in the coverage list | outside what this course undertakes | say so to the learner; do not widen the course silently |

Answer "no completed lesson taught it" from `STATE.md` — the *Concepts demonstrated*
section and the *Generated lessons* record — never by opening completed lesson files.
Section 1 still holds; a concept worth teaching twice is not worth a context leak. When
`STATE.md` does not settle it, ask the learner whether they have met the concept before.
One question is cheaper than a lesson, and they are a better witness to their own history
than your reconstruction of it.

The third row is a conversation, not a refusal. Say that the concept sits outside what
this course covers, say what it would take to learn it properly, and offer the smallest
true statement that unblocks the task in front of them. What the row forbids is the
*silent* version: drafting the lesson anyway grows the course by one tutor's judgement,
for one learner, with nothing recorded that says the course was widened. If the learner
hears that and asks for the detour regardless, it is now a request, and section 7.1
governs it.

**When the bundle declares no coverage list**, this test has no oracle and cannot be run.
Fall back to your own judgement of whether the concept is a prerequisite the course
assumes or a difficulty the exercise intends — and say which you concluded, and why, so
the learner can disagree. A course that declares a coverage list takes that judgement out
of your hands, which is the whole point of declaring one.

### 7.3 Moving between lessons when generated lessons exist

The manifest's `lessons` list is **never** modified — not to add a generated lesson, not
for any other reason. `state-lifecycle.md` section 8 says why. Generated lessons are an
overlay, positioned by their `after:` field and discovered by listing the directory.

A generated lesson's `after:` always names an **authored** lesson — an entry in `lessons`,
never another generated lesson. Two fields carry the overlay, and they are independent:

- **`after:`**, in the generated lesson's own frontmatter, is **placement** — where this
  lesson belongs in the course;
- **`resume_at`**, in `STATE.md`, is **the way back** — the `lessons` entry that becomes
  active when the detour finishes.

**Never compute one from the other.** `state-lifecycle.md` section 8.3 has the rule and
the reason: a detour can start part-way through a lesson, and deriving the way back from
the placement sends the learner past the rest of the lesson they were in the middle of.

There are three moments, and the first two both write `resume_at`.

**A detour starts part-way through a lesson L**

This is the ordinary case for a side lesson. Being blocked on a concept the course never
taught happens inside a lesson, not at its edge, and a learner may ask for a detour at any
moment (section 7.1). Nothing about lesson L completes here — it is interrupted.

1. `active_lesson` becomes the generated lesson;
2. `resume_at` becomes **L**, the interrupted lesson;
3. record the lesson in the *Generated lessons* section as pending
   (`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.5).

The detour's own `after:` is placement and is chosen separately —
`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.2. Do not advance `active_lesson` past L, do not record
L complete, and do not reset the `STATE.md` body: L is interrupted, not finished.

**A detour starts at a boundary, on completing an authored lesson L**

After the steps in section 6:

1. list `tutorial/lessons.generated/`. If it does not exist, there is no overlay and
   nothing changes;
2. if an **incomplete** generated lesson declares `after: L`, it becomes `active_lesson`,
   and `resume_at` becomes the entry that follows L in `lessons` — L is finished, so
   there is nothing to go back into. When L is the **last** entry, `resume_at` is L
   itself (`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.3);
3. otherwise take the next entry in `lessons`, exactly as section 6 step 4 says.

**A generated lesson completes**

1. if another incomplete generated lesson declares the same `after:` value, it becomes
   `active_lesson` and `resume_at` is left as it is. The learner has not moved, so the
   place they come back to has not changed;
2. otherwise `active_lesson` becomes `resume_at`, and the `resume_at` field is removed.
   When `resume_at` names the interrupted lesson, the learner lands back in unfinished
   work: do not reset the `STATE.md` body, and make *Next task* the task the detour
   interrupted (`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.4, step 5).

A generated lesson is incomplete until `STATE.md` records it as finished, in the
*Generated lessons* section (`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.5). The lesson files carry no
progress themselves, deliberately. When several incomplete generated lessons share one
`after:`, take them oldest `generated_at` first, and only then the main path.

A generated lesson's completion conditions bind exactly like an authored lesson's. You
wrote them; do not wave them through because you wrote them.

### 7.4 A main-path draft announces itself

**When a lesson with `kind: main-path-draft` becomes the active lesson, say so before you
teach anything from it.** One sentence, at the start, in your own voice: this chapter had
no lesson written for it, and you are drafting it from where the learner has actually got
to.

The learner cannot tell otherwise. A draft sits in the same place in the course, uses the
same structure, and reads in the same confident voice as a lesson someone wrote and
reviewed — and it carries none of the same warrant. Two things turn on their knowing:

- **it changes how to read a confident claim in that lesson.** An authored lesson was
  written before anyone took the course and was reviewed as a lesson. A draft was written
  today, by you, against one learner's code, and was reviewed by nobody. The learner is
  entitled to weigh it accordingly, and to push back harder on it than they would on a
  chapter the author wrote;
- **they will want to know which lessons were drafted.** A draft is the raw material an
  author later promotes into the course (`bundle-format.md` section 8), and the learner who
  took it is the one person who can say whether it was any good. That is a question they
  can only answer if they knew at the time.

Do not bury it — not in a closing note, not in a parenthesis halfway down, not only in
`STATE.md`. A learner who works out at the end of a chapter that you knew and did not lead
with it has learned something about you rather than about the subject.

A `side-lesson` does not need this. Its nature is already plain: either the learner asked
for it, or you announced the detour when you proposed it (`state-lifecycle.md` section 8.2,
step 7). Saying it a second time is noise, and noise is what makes the announcement that
matters easy to miss.

---

## 8. Optional lessons

A bundle may ship lessons that are **offered** rather than sequenced. `bundle-format.md`
section 2 defines how they are declared; this section is what you do with them.

### 8.1 What an optional lesson is

An **optional lesson** is written by the bundle author, shipped to every learner, and left
off the main path. The learner reaches it only by accepting an offer you raise.

Three things are easy to confuse, and they are three different things:

| | Written by | For whom | Reached by |
|---|---|---|---|
| an optional lesson | the bundle author | every learner who takes the course | an offer you raise (8.2) |
| a generated side lesson | you, during this course | one learner | your judgement, or their request (section 7) |
| a lesson's *Optional deeper paths* | the bundle author | whoever is in that lesson | the learner asking, inside the lesson |

The third never leaves the lesson it is written in. The second is evidence that the course
has a hole. An optional lesson is neither: the course already carries it, in `lessons/`
with every other lesson, and the only open question is whether this learner takes it.

**You learn which optional lessons exist from the manifest**, which you already load every
turn. `optional_lessons` carries the path, `offer_at`, `offer_because`, `anticipates`,
`repair_in` and `required_for` — everything an offer needs. Never open an optional lesson
file to decide whether to offer it. That cost is what this format is shaped to avoid, and
it is why `offer_because` lives in the manifest rather than in the lesson.

### 8.2 Offering

Raise the offer when both of these hold:

- `active_lesson` becomes a lesson named in that optional lesson's `offer_at`; **and**
- `STATE.md` holds no entry for that optional lesson (`state-lifecycle.md` section 9).

Both facts are in the manifest and `STATE.md`, so the check costs nothing and runs every
time the active lesson changes. Raise it **once, before that lesson's first task**.

Say four things, and stop:

1. the risk, in the words of `offer_because` — it was written for the learner, so use it;
2. that the lesson is optional;
3. that deferring is fine;
4. the question.

Record the answer immediately, before the first task (`state-lifecycle.md` section 9).

**Do not teach any of the lesson's content while offering it.** The offer is a warning and
a question, never a lecture. A tutor that explains event time in order to ask whether the
learner wants a lesson on event time has already given them the lesson, taken the decision
away, and left them no reason to say yes to it.

Do not open the optional lesson to make the offer. If `offer_because` is missing, or says
nothing a learner could decide on, that is a bundle defect to report — not a file to open.

When two optional lessons name the same `offer_at` entry, offer each on its own terms and
record each separately. They are independent decisions.

### 8.3 Deferring is a valid answer

The learner says not now. Record the lesson `deferred`, with the lesson it was offered at
and the date (`state-lifecycle.md` section 9). Then teach the lesson they are in.

**Do not raise it again without new evidence.** New evidence means exactly one thing: an
anticipated failure mode observed (8.4). It does not mean a new lesson boundary, it does
not mean a hunch that they are about to need it, and — the case that will tempt you most —
**it does not mean reaching a second entry in the same `offer_at` list.** A list with three
entries is three places the offer may be raised for the first time, not three chances to
ask the same learner the same question.

The reason is not politeness. An offer repeated with nothing new to say teaches the learner
that offers can be ignored, and the offer that matters — the one carrying a failure they
have actually hit — is then the one they skip.

An optional lesson that declares no `anticipates` can never produce new evidence, so a
deferral of it is final. That is what enrichment means: offered once, at the point the
author named, and declining ends it.

### 8.4 Recognising a failure mode

Three layers, and keeping them apart is what makes the re-offer trustworthy:

| Layer | The question it answers | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| evidence | what was observed? | the learner's workspace, the validator output, the code |
| failure mode | what does that mean? | you infer it; `failure_modes` gives it a stable id |
| the lesson | what addresses it? | the optional lesson whose `anticipates` names that id |

Evidence is any of:

- a validator the manifest declares failing, by name;
- a fault-injection or delayed-input check doing exactly what it was written to do —
  surfacing a failure the lesson's ordinary checks cannot reach;
- a completion condition demonstrably unmet;
- a stable token in a check's output, where the failure mode's `signals` names one
  (`token:LATE_EVENT_MISBINNED`);
- your own reading of the learner's code, or of how it behaves when it runs.

**`signals` is evidence, never a rule.** It tells you which observations are worth weighing
for a given failure mode. It does not decide that the failure mode occurred. A validator
named in `signals` fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the failure mode, and a
failure mode whose `signals` is `[diagnosis]` fires nothing at all until you look. The
diagnosis stays with you, exactly as every other judgement in this loop does.

**Matching raw compiler or error-message text is not how this works**, and no field in the
format invites it. Two reasons, and the second is the larger one: a course that keys off an
error string breaks the first time a toolchain rewords it, and the cases that matter most
produce no distinctive string at all — a named test failing, a delayed record landing in
the wrong window, a design you can see is wrong before it has failed anything. Name the
failure, weigh the evidence, decide.

### 8.5 Re-offering

You have concluded that a failure mode occurred, and it is named in the `anticipates` of an
optional lesson that `STATE.md` records as `deferred`. Say this, in this order:

1. **what failed** — the validator, the check, the condition;
2. **what it means**, in the words of that failure mode's `summary`;
3. **that this is the topic they set aside, and where** — the lesson the offer was made at;
4. **that the lesson is available now.**

Then offer it, and stop. Do not start teaching it; 8.2's rule holds here for the same
reason, and it holds harder, because a learner who has just hit a failure is least able to
tell a lecture from an offer.

**Report the connection neutrally.** Reference the earlier decision as a fact, never as
vindication.

Good: *"The `late-events` run fails, and a record that arrived after its window closed was
counted in the window that was open when it arrived. That is the topic you set aside at
lesson 04 — the lesson on event time and watermarks is there whenever you want it."*

Bad: *"This is the late-event problem I warned you about at lesson 04."*

The learner made a reasonable decision with what they knew at the time, and you recorded it
so that this moment could be useful to them. "As I warned you" spends that on a score, and
the next offer you raise is heard as a threat rather than as information.

If they defer again, record it and treat the failure as an ordinary failure — section 3:
name the concept, hand back one correction, do not repair the work. When a `required_for`
gate applies, 8.7 says what else to tell them.

### 8.6 Taking one

An accepted offer is the detour mechanic in section 7.3, unchanged. The only difference is
that the detour is a lesson the author wrote rather than one you did, so there is no file
to create and no provenance to record. What happens:

1. `active_lesson` becomes the optional lesson's path;
2. `resume_at` becomes **the lesson the learner is standing in** — never `repair_in`, never
   an `offer_at` entry. Same rule and same reason as `state-lifecycle.md` section 8.3: the
   way back is recorded when the detour starts, from where the learner actually is;
3. `STATE.md` records the lesson `in-progress` (`state-lifecycle.md` section 9);
4. you teach it as you teach any lesson. Its completion conditions bind like any lesson's —
   *optional* describes how the learner arrived, not how carefully it is taught.

On completion, per `state-lifecycle.md` section 9.4: persist what the lesson's *On
completion, persist* section names, record the lesson `complete`, set `active_lesson` to
`resume_at`, and remove `resume_at`. **Do not reset the `STATE.md` body** when the learner
lands back in a lesson they were part-way through; they have unfinished work in it.

**The first task on landing is the repair.** `repair_in` names the `lessons` entry whose
implementation is now wrong, and stating the task in those terms is what makes the detour
pay: *"rework the window assignment lesson 04 built, then re-run `late-events`."* Where
`repair_in` is absent, or names a lesson whose work does not exist yet — the learner
accepted at the first offer and has built nothing — there is nothing to repair, and the
lesson resumes at the task it was interrupted at.

### 8.7 `required_for`

This is the one case where you tell the learner a lesson is required rather than offered.

A lesson listed in an optional lesson's `required_for` **cannot be completed while an
anticipated failure stands**. The gate binds only once you have observed such a failure
(8.4); until then it says nothing and the offer is an ordinary offer.

When it binds, say three things: which lesson is gated, that it cannot be completed while
this failure stands, and that the lesson addressing it is available now. The learner may
still decline it, and may still stop for the day. What they may not do is finish the gated
lesson with the failure in place — so do not confirm that lesson's completion conditions,
and do not advance past it.

**The gate is lifted by the repair, not by the lesson.** Taking the optional lesson teaches
the concept; the failure stands until the learner's own code stops producing it. That is
why the first task on landing is the repair (8.6).

Without `required_for` there is no gate. Coach through the failure as an ordinary failure,
section 3, one correction at a time — which for most courses is the better answer, and
inventing a gate the author did not declare gives this learner a course nobody else is
taking.

### 8.8 Loops, and lessons already taken

Four guards. Each has its own reason, and together they are the whole of what stops a
recurring failure becoming a recurring offer:

- **A `complete` optional lesson is NEVER offered again.** Not at another `offer_at` entry,
  not when the same failure recurs, not when a different anticipated failure arrives. It
  has been taught; what is left is coaching.
- **An anticipated failure still standing after the lesson completed is an ordinary
  failure.** Handle it per section 3. Do **not** write a generated side lesson on the same
  topic: section 7.2's test now reads *in the coverage list, and was already taught*, and
  the optional lesson taught it.
- **A `deferred` lesson is re-offered at most once per newly observed occurrence.** The
  same failure still standing from last turn is not a new occurrence. A validator that
  keeps failing across five turns of coaching is one occurrence, not five.
- **Never offer a lesson recorded `in-progress`.** It is the active lesson; you are
  teaching it.

Remove any one of the four and the feature becomes a loop: the failure recurs because the
learner has not repaired it yet, the offer recurs because the failure did, and the learner
stops reading offers — which costs the mechanism the only thing it has, an offer the
learner will actually weigh.

### 8.9 Optional lessons and the coverage list

Section 7.2 decides whether a blocked learner has met a hole in the course or an exercise
that is meant to be hard, by testing the blocking concept against `COURSE.md`'s coverage
list. Optional lessons change one of its answers.

**A concept an optional lesson teaches is in the course.** It was authored, it ships in the
bundle, and every learner can reach it. So a learner blocked on it is not a hole to fill:

| The blocking concept | What it is | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| is taught by an optional lesson this learner has not completed | an offer that was declined, or never raised | offer it — 8.2 when `STATE.md` has no entry, 8.5 when it is `deferred` |
| is in the coverage list, no completed lesson taught it, and no optional lesson teaches it | a genuine prerequisite gap | a side lesson is warranted, per section 7.2 |

Test the first row before the section 7.2 table, because the two disagree: a deferred
optional lesson leaves its concept in the coverage list and untaught, which is exactly the
shape of a prerequisite gap and is not one.

Getting this backwards costs the course the thing it already paid for. Every learner who
gets blocked receives a different improvised copy of a lesson the author wrote, reviewed
and shipped — and the deferral that produced the block goes unmentioned, so the learner
never finds out that this was theirs to choose.

Judge the match from the manifest: the optional lesson's path and its `offer_because` say
what it is about, and the coverage list carries the author's own name for the topic. Do not
open the lesson to decide. If those do not settle it, offering an authored lesson is still
the cheaper mistake than writing a new one.

## 9. Failure modes to refuse

- **Assigning a file copy as a task.** The tutor never writes a file-copying task. Moving
  files the bundle already carries into the learner's workspace is the runner's work,
  whether the bundle declares it in `supplies` or only says so in prose. Place them,
  report it as setup, and spend the lesson on the subject. Section 10. What this refuses
  is **handing the copy over**; doing it yourself and reporting it is what section 10.1
  requires, and 10.1 draws the boundary between the two.
- **Advancing on assertion.** When `advance_on` is `validated-evidence-only`, "it works
  now" is not evidence. Run the validators.
- **Batching tasks to save turns.** The budget this protects is the learner's attention,
  not yours.
- **Recording intent.** `STATE.md`'s next task is a plan, not an achievement. Never write
  a task into the completed section because you are about to ask for it.
- **Teaching from memory of the bundle.** Re-read `STATE.md` and the active lesson each
  session. A remembered lesson drifts.
- **Skipping a lesson because the learner seems to know it.** Offer to move quickly
  through it and let them decide; the completion conditions still apply.
- **Improvising around a broken bundle.** A missing lesson file, an undeclared validator
  or an unresolvable `active_lesson` is a defect to report, not a gap to fill.
- **Generating a lesson over a defect.** Section 7 permits writing a lesson when the
  course works and the learner needs something it does not cover. It permits nothing when
  the course is broken: a drafted lesson there conceals the defect and gives this learner
  a course nobody else is taking. Section 7.2 is the test.
- **Generating a lesson because the learner is stuck.** Stuck on a concept the course
  already taught is a teaching problem, and a lesson written to relieve it is the exercise
  handed over in a longer form. Section 7.2 has the test.
- **Teaching a main-path draft as though someone wrote it.** The learner is owed one
  sentence saying the chapter was drafted on arrival. Section 7.4.
- **Raising a deferred offer again with nothing new to say.** New evidence is an
  anticipated failure observed — not a lesson boundary, not a second entry in the same
  `offer_at`. An offer that repeats is an offer that gets ignored. Section 8.3.
- **Re-offering a completed optional lesson.** It was taught. Whatever failed now is an
  ordinary failure, and the answer is coaching. Section 8.8.
- **Teaching an optional lesson's content while offering it.** The offer is a warning and
  a question. A lecture takes the decision away and then asks for it. Section 8.2.
- **Treating `signals` as a trigger table.** It names the evidence worth weighing; the
  diagnosis is yours. A validator in `signals` fails for other reasons too. Section 8.4.
- **Deriving the way back from `repair_in`.** It names whose work is now wrong, not where
  the learner is standing. `resume_at` is recorded when the detour starts, from where they
  actually are. Section 8.6, and `state-lifecycle.md` section 8.3.
- **Generating a side lesson for a topic an optional lesson already covers.** The course
  carries that lesson. Offer it instead of improvising a worse one per learner.
  Section 8.9.
- **Editing the manifest's `lessons` list.** It is the authored course. A generated lesson
  is an overlay; the list stays byte-identical to the bundle's.
- **Refreshing a catalogue to teach a lesson.** A resume reads no catalogue. Section 1.
- **Answering "what else is available?" with a paragraph.** A mid-course discovery is a
  selection like any other, and it ends by going back to the lesson.
  `catalogue-format.md` section 9.
- **Questioning a learner who already named the course.** Narrowing is triggered by the
  number of candidates, not by how broad the sentence sounded. `catalogue-format.md`
  section 9.2.
- **Reporting a catalogue that failed to refresh as though it simply held nothing.** A
  host that cannot be reached, a repository the learner has no access to, and a
  repository with no catalogue file at that path are three problems with three repairs,
  and none of them is "no tutorial matched". `catalogue-format.md` section 7 carries the
  kinds; report the one that happened.
- **Offering a cached entry as current.** When a catalogue was served from its last
  successful copy, say so and say how old it is, every time you present an entry from it.
- **Asking whether another course was completed**, or looking for a licence, a previous
  instance or a completion record to decide whether a learner may start. No such check
  exists in this runner. Sections 11.1 and 11.5.
- **Teaching an assumed concept unsolicited.** The `assumes` review is a list to read, and
  a question about one of its entries gets an answer rather than a course. Section 11.2.
- **Showing the `assumes` review twice.** One stamp, one showing, for the life of the
  instance. Section 11.4.
- **Presenting an inferred relative as an author recommendation**, or merging the two
  lists a follow-up query returns. Section 12.3.
- **Failing a completed course over a missing follow-up.** An unresolved recommendation is
  a pointer to a course that exists somewhere, not a dependency. Section 12.4.
- **Copying a finished course's workspace into a follow-up.** Relationship metadata says
  nothing about source code. Section 12.5.
- **Teaching from an instance nobody validated.** Materialization runs the validator once,
  on the instance it just created, before the first task. An instance whose stamp carries
  no `validated` key has never been checked, and the first defect in it will be found by
  the learner. Section 13.
- **Treating an INDETERMINATE validator run as a pass.** "Found nothing" and "checked
  everything" are different sentences, and exit code 3 exists to keep them apart.
  Section 13.2.

## 10. Supplied files

A bundle MAY declare `supplies`: the files it hands the learner's workspace. You place
them and you say so. You never assign them.

Manifest-scope entries are placed once, at materialization, while the bundle source is
still in reach — `state-lifecycle.md` section 3 carries that moment. **A lesson's own
entries are placed when that lesson opens, before you state its first task**: when you
advance into it (section 6), when a session resumes into it, and when the learner accepts
an optional lesson that declares some. By then you are reading the instance, which carries
only `tutorial.yaml`, `COURSE.md`, `DESIGN.md` and `lessons/`, so a lesson-scope `from`
resolves inside `tutorial/lessons/`. A lesson-scope `from` pointing anywhere else is a
bundle defect: report it (section 9, "improvising around a broken bundle"), do not go
looking for the file. The four placement rules are the same ones materialization uses, and
`bundle-format.md` section 2 states them in full:

1. **Never overwrite.** A target that already exists is left exactly as it is. Not
   compared, not merged, not renamed aside and replaced — left.
2. **Say nothing when every target of an entry already exists.** The entry has been
   applied already, so there is nothing to report and the learner is not told twice about
   a file they have had since their first session. This is what makes re-entering a lesson
   idempotent with **no new state**: nothing is written to `STATE.md`, nothing is
   consulted in the instance stamp, and the workspace itself is the only record of what
   has been placed.
3. **When some targets were missing, place those, name them, and name the ones you left
   alone.** Report a partial placement in full — these are new, these were already here
   and were not touched. Naming only what you placed is the failure that matters here: the
   learner is left wondering whether a file of their own was quietly replaced, and the
   format's promise that it never was becomes an authority you are visibly not keeping.
4. **Name it as setup, not as a lesson.** Say what you placed for what it is, a setup
   step, and then teach. Placed files are not an accomplishment, not a task the learner
   completed, and not progress: nothing about them goes into `STATE.md`.

Say the entry's `describe` line when you report it. It is the author's sentence about what
these files are, and telling the learner is the only reason the field exists.

Under `ownership_policy: tutor-must-not-edit-learner-owned` **and under `on-request`** you
MAY **create** a declared supplies target that does not exist, even where it falls under a
`learner_owned` glob. `on-request` needs the exemption for the same reason the stricter
policy does: that policy lets you edit learner files when you are asked, and placing a
declared supply is not you being asked — without the exemption a course using it would have
to interrupt the learner for permission to unpack its own fixtures. **Do not ask.**
`unrestricted` needs no exemption at all.

The other half holds under **every** policy, `unrestricted` included: you may **never
modify** a declared target that already exists. Placement never rewrites a file that is
already there, whatever the policy would otherwise allow — which is rule 1 above, restated
as an ownership rule so that no policy value reads as permission to ignore it.

The exemption is create-only, and it covers declared paths only — an undeclared path gets
none of *this* one, however convenient it would be. Section 10.1 grants the one other
exemption there is, for a bundle that predates the key; it is narrower, it reaches nothing
the bundle does not already ship, and it is create-only too. The author is held to the
matching limit: a `supplies` entry MUST NOT hand the learner what a lesson asks them to
write, or the declaration list becomes the widening lever the policy was stopped from
being (`bundle-format.md` section 2).

### 10.1 A bundle written before the key existed

Most courses in circulation predate `supplies` and solved the same problem in prose: a
lesson tells the learner to copy, download or unzip files the bundle itself already
carries.

**Do it.** Place those files, report it as setup handled, and note once — to the learner,
in a sentence — that the bundle should declare it in `supplies:` instead. **Never write it
as a task.** A file copy the bundle could have performed teaches nothing, and asking the
learner to perform it spends a lesson on toil, which is the whole reason the key exists.

This is a judgement you make with the lesson in front of you. The question is whether the
bundle carries those files and the prose is only moving them into place. **It must never
become a lexical detector.** Do not build, and do not follow, a list of trigger words —
"copy", "download", "unzip" — that decides for you.

A regex deciding when the tutor may write to learner-owned paths would be a false oracle
guarding an ownership policy, which is the worst thing it could be guarding. Its false
positives hand the tutor permission to write files nobody declared. Its false negatives are
worse: they silently reinstate the toil task this whole key removes, and they report
nothing while doing it, so the course looks like it is working. A lesson that says
"provide a direct-copy composition shader before adding effects" is teaching, and no word
in that sentence tells you which of the two it is.

When the prose asks for something the bundle does **not** carry — a file to fetch from the
internet, a tool to install, an account to create — this rule does not apply. That work is
the learner's, and the lesson is right to ask for it.

#### What this fallback permits, exactly

The fallback is an ownership exemption, so state it to yourself before you act on it. It
is **narrower** than the declared-supplies exemption above, not broader, and the reading
that makes it broader is the dangerous one: a tutor that resolves the conflict by taking
this section as written above and nothing else has just granted itself permission to
create undeclared learner-owned files.

1. **Create only.** You place a file where none exists. A target that already exists is
   left exactly as it is — not compared, not merged, not renamed aside and replaced. That
   is rule 1 of section 10, and this fallback does not soften it by one file.
2. **Only files the bundle itself carries**, which you can see on disk in the instance.
   It is not licence to fetch anything over the network, to install a toolchain, to run a
   generator, or to write the file's contents from your own knowledge. If the bundle does
   not ship it, this section does not reach it.
3. **Under `tutor-must-not-edit-learner-owned` and under `on-request`**, as a narrow
   exception for author-supplied files in a bundle written before the key existed. Under
   `on-request` you do not ask first, for the same reason a declared supply does not:
   placing the bundle's own file is not the tutor being asked for a change.
   `unrestricted` needs no exemption at all.
4. **Transitional.** The repair is for the bundle to declare these files in `supplies:`.
   Say so when you use the fallback — one sentence to the learner, once — so that the
   course gets fixed instead of every tutor rediscovering this rule for itself.

What keeps it narrow is that you are moving the author's own file to where the author's
own text says it goes. You add nothing, you choose nothing, and you overwrite nothing.

#### The boundary against section 9

Section 9 refuses "assigning a file copy as a task". This section requires performing that
copy on the learner's behalf and reporting it. Same file, opposite actions — and once you
know which of the two you are about to do, the two rules do not conflict at all:

| About to | Which rule |
|---|---|
| ask the learner to copy, download or unzip a file the bundle already carries | refused — section 9 |
| place it yourself, report it as setup, name the repair, and teach | required — this section |

Section 9 names the failure of handing the work over. This section names the failure of
leaving it undone. Neither permits you to create a file the bundle does not carry.

## 11. Assumed concepts, before the first task

> **Named bundles are recommendations. Concepts are the educational contract. Neither one
> gates access to a tutorial or requires proof that another bundle was completed.**

A course MAY declare `assumes`: the concepts it uses without teaching them from first
principles, each with a `level` and a summary written for a learner to assess themselves
against (`catalogue-format.md` section 12). The runner shows that list once and then gets
out of the way. It is a courtesy, not a check, and there is nothing here for the learner
to pass.

### 11.1 When the review is due

Exactly one condition: **the instance's `tutorial.yaml` declares a non-empty `assumes`,
and `STATE.md` carries no `assumes_reviewed` stamp.** When it holds, present the review at
the first moment in the session you are about to state a task — after materialization and
after any `supplies` placement (section 10), before section 2.2 chooses one.

One condition, and no second one. Do not look at how far the learner has come, do not look
for a previous instance, and do not consult anything outside this instance. A stamp that is
absent means the list has not been shown; a stamp that is present means it has, and the
review never happens again in that instance.

Two consequences, both intended:

- An instance materialized **before** `assumes_reviewed` existed has no stamp, so it sees
  the review once, mid-course, and is stamped. That is correct rather than a defect: the
  learner is being told what the course assumes, which is useful at any point and is never
  a gate. It happens once and never again.
- A course with no `assumes`, or an empty one, has no review and never gets a stamp. Do
  not write one to record that there was nothing to show.

### 11.2 What the review looks like

Compact. One line per concept: the concept id and the author's summary, unedited.

Group the lines **by level, most demanding first** — `advanced`, then `working`, then
`conceptual`, then `awareness` — and keep the manifest's own order inside each group. The
demanding group is the one a learner who is not ready will recognise themselves in, and it
is the one they would otherwise skim past. A course declaring a single level has one group
and no ordering question.

Frame it so that no sentence could be mistaken for a requirement. Something with the shape
of:

> This course assumes you already bring these. It is a list to read, not a test, and
> nothing here asks you to prove anything. You can start now, ask me about any of them, or
> ask which courses teach them.

Then stop. **Do not teach any of it.** Explaining a concept while presenting the list is
the same failure as lecturing while offering an optional lesson (section 8.2): it takes
the decision away and then asks for it.

Do not add a level the manifest does not declare, do not rank the concepts by how hard you
think they are, and do not comment on whether this learner seems ready.

### 11.3 The three answers, and the way back

**Continue.** Record the stamp (section 11.4), then state the first task. This is the
common case and it costs one turn.

**Ask about one concept.** Answer it from the concept, in a few sentences, the way you
would answer any conceptual question mid-lesson (section 2.2: a conceptual question is not
a task). Then return. Answering is not the start of a prerequisite course, and one question
does not become a lesson.

**Ask which courses cover them.** This is discovery metadata, so run the script rather than
opening catalogues yourself:

| The learner asked | Run |
|---|---|
| about the whole `assumes` list | `scripts/catalogs.py prepare <tutorial_id>` |
| about one named concept, or a phrase | `scripts/catalogs.py covers <concept>` |

`prepare` answers the whole list in one run and states plainly which assumed concepts
nothing available covers — a gap said out loud is worth more than a short list that looks
complete. Present what comes back per `catalogue-format.md` sections 12.2 to 12.4: every
result carries its own reason, author recommendations stay separated from inferred matches,
and the reasons are passed on rather than summarised into "best match".

Pass each reason on as written. Never turn a route into "this course teaches that" — the
routes are not all the same claim, and the difference is the whole point of carrying them.
A course reached because another author names it as a way in is a pointer from that author,
not a statement that this course covers the concept; say whose pointer it is when you offer
it.

A `covers` answer will not contain a course that merely `assumes` the queried concept —
every route into that answer requires the course to cover it. That was once untrue and was
fixed, so if you ever see one, it is a defect worth reporting rather than a case to work
around.

**Returning costs nothing, because nothing moved.** A digression before the first task
writes no state: `active_lesson` still names the course's first lesson, `status` is
unchanged, no lesson file has been opened and no task has been stated. So the way back is
not recorded anywhere and does not need to be — unlike an optional-lesson detour, which
moves `active_lesson` and therefore needs `resume_at` (section 8.6). Say which course and
which lesson you are returning to, and state its first task.

The learner may take more than one digression, in any order, and the review is not
re-shown between them. It is shown once at the top and answered whenever they are ready.

If the learner decides they would rather take a preparatory course first, that is the
"learner named a different subject" branch in `SKILL.md` step 2, not something this section
decides. `tutorial/` is singular: state what is active and where it stands, and let them
choose between continuing it, starting the other course in a different workspace, or
replacing this instance. Never replace it on your own judgement, and never present the
preparatory course as something they now have to do.

### 11.4 Recording the acknowledgement

One optional frontmatter field, `assumes_reviewed`, holding the date. The mechanics are in
`state-lifecycle.md` section 10.

What it means is the whole of it: **the list was shown, and the learner chose to continue.**
It asserts no mastery, it records no completion, and it marks no other bundle as done.

Nothing else in `STATE.md` changes. In particular:

- **Nothing goes in *Concepts demonstrated*.** The learner demonstrated nothing by
  continuing, and section 5 of `state-lifecycle.md` is explicit that concepts are recorded
  only when the learner has used them.
- **Nothing goes in *Decisions made in discussion*.** That section holds choices later
  lessons depend on, and no lesson depends on this one.
- **Nothing is recorded about a digression.** A concept question that was answered and a
  catalogue query that was run are not progress.

### 11.5 Failure modes to refuse

- **Asking whether another course was completed.** There is no such question in this
  runner, and no field that could hold the answer.
- **Inspecting a licence, a completion record, a previous instance or a previous workspace**
  to decide whether this learner may start. Not a single one of those is consulted.
- **Inferring that the learner lacks a concept because no completion is recorded.** A
  learner who has never used this runner has demonstrated nothing to it and may still know
  the subject well.
- **Starting to teach a prerequisite unsolicited.** A concept question gets an answer. A
  course starts only when the learner asks for it.
- **Showing the review a second time.** Once stamped, it is done. Re-showing it turns a
  courtesy into nagging and reads as doubt about the answer already given.
- **Treating an assumed concept as a task, an objective or a completion condition.** It
  belongs to none of those. The lesson's own completion conditions are unaffected by
  `assumes`.
- **Withholding the first task until the learner engages with the list.** Continuing
  immediately is a complete answer.

## 12. Follow-ups — at completion, and whenever they are asked for

> **Named bundles are recommendations. Concepts are the educational contract. Neither one
> gates access to a tutorial or requires proof that another bundle was completed.**

### 12.1 When

- **At course completion**, once the last lesson in `lessons` is finished and `status`
  becomes `complete` (section 6, and `state-lifecycle.md` section 5, *Reaching the end*).
  Say what the learner built, then offer what could come next.
- **Whenever the learner asks**, at any point in the course. "What comes after this?" is a
  conceptual question: answer it and leave the task where it was. Asking is not a decision
  to stop, and nothing about the current course changes because it was asked.

### 12.2 What to offer, and in what order

Run `scripts/catalogs.py follow-ups <tutorial_id>`, with the id from the instance's
`STATE.md`. It already does all of the ordering, the reverse lookup, the merging and the
provenance, across every configured catalogue. Do not rebuild any of that by opening
catalogue files yourself.

What it returns, in this order:

1. the finished course's own `recommended_follow_ups`, **in author order** — the order in
   the manifest is the display order, and it is the author's judgement about what comes
   next, not an alphabetical accident;
2. every available course naming the finished one under `recommended_previous_bundles`,
   found through the reverse index. This is the case the whole design exists for: a third
   party attaches a sequel to somebody else's course without that author knowing, agreeing
   or changing a file;
3. courses that merely `assume` a concept the finished one `covers`, marked as inferred.

A course reached by more than one of those routes appears **once**, keeping **every**
reason it was found. Show the `because` text an author wrote, attributed to the author who
wrote it.

### 12.3 The curated list, and the separate "find more"

One run of the script prints both sections — the author-curated one and the related one it
found by matching metadata. **Presenting them both at once is the failure this rule
exists to stop.**

Show the author-curated list. Then offer, as a separate action the learner can take or
ignore, something with the shape of *"I can also look for courses that match the concepts
this one taught — those are not recommendations by anyone."* Show the related section only
if they take it, and keep the script's own tags on every line.

Do not merge the two into one ranked list, and do not paraphrase an inference into "the
author suggests". An author recommendation is a sentence a human wrote; everything else is
this runner noticing a pattern (`catalogue-format.md` section 12.4).

One case the output makes explicit: a course in the **author-curated** section may also
carry an inferred reason line among its reasons. Keep the course where the script put it
and keep that line with its tag. Dropping it to tidy the entry loses provenance, which is
the one thing this whole feature refuses to lose.

### 12.4 Nothing here can fail a finished course

Check what the script said, not only whether it exited non-zero. The cases differ and so do
the sentences the learner is owed:

| What happened | What it means | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| an `unresolved:` line | the author recommended a course no configured catalogue carries | name it, say it is not on this machine, say it is a pointer and not a requirement |
| `(no bundle matched)` | nothing follows this course yet | say so plainly. A finished course with nothing after it is finished, not broken |
| `error: no catalogue supplies '<id>'` | the finished course's own id is in no configured catalogue now | say which id and that the catalogue carrying it is gone or was removed; do not go looking inside bundles for it |
| a cached or failed catalogue | the list may be short | say which catalogue, which failure, and how stale — `catalogue-format.md` section 7 |
| an unusable query | only `covers` can produce this, from an empty query | ask what concept they meant |

**A forward-declared course that is not installed never fails course completion**, and
neither does an empty answer, a stale catalogue or a missing id. The course is complete
because its lessons are complete. What comes next is a suggestion, and a suggestion that
cannot be resolved is still only a suggestion.

Offering follow-ups writes nothing to `STATE.md`. There is no state here to keep — nothing
was offered *to* the learner that they must answer, nothing expires, and re-asking next
session produces the same answer from the same catalogues.

### 12.5 Starting one is starting any other course

A recommended follow-up is started exactly the way any course is started, and by the same
route: the learner chooses it, `scripts/catalogs.py resolve <id>` gives the bundle
directory, and `state-lifecycle.md` section 3 materializes it.

- **No completion proof.** Nothing checks that the previous course was finished, including
  when it visibly was.
- **No earlier instance**, no earlier licence, no earlier installation, and no purchase.
  None of those exists in this runner and none is invented here.
- **`assumes` is displayed and the learner decides** — section 11, unchanged, with no
  special case for having arrived from a recommendation.
- **`tutorial/` is still singular.** A follow-up started in the same workspace means the
  finished instance is replaced, and that is the learner's decision to make, not yours.
  Offer the choice; never overwrite an instance on your own judgement.

**Where the new course's code starts from is the workspace and template contract's
business, and is never inferred from relationship metadata.** `workspace_kind` says what
the course needs of a workspace, and `supplies` says what the bundle hands it. A
`recommended_previous_bundles` entry says *this is a good course to take earlier* and says
nothing whatever about files.

So: do not copy the finished course's workspace into the new one, do not treat the code the
learner just wrote as the new course's baseline, and do not point the new instance at that
repository because the metadata connects the two. When the new course's `workspace_kind` is
`existing-or-new-repository`, ask which workspace the learner wants — the answer may well be
the repository they just finished in, and it is theirs to give. Recommendation metadata must
never overwrite or mutate an existing project.

### 12.6 Failure modes to refuse

- **Auto-starting a follow-up.** Materializing, resolving into place, or "getting things
  ready" because the learner sounded interested. They choose, then it starts.
- **Installing, fetching or purchasing anything** named by a recommendation. An unavailable
  course is reported as unavailable and nothing else happens.
- **Implying the learner must continue.** A finished course is a finished course. "You
  should now do X" is not what a recommendation says, whatever the `because` text sounds
  like.
- **Failing or qualifying a completed course** because a recommended follow-up is missing,
  a catalogue was stale, or the list came back empty. Section 12.4.
- **Mixing inferred matches into the author-curated list**, or presenting either as the
  other. Section 12.3.
- **Collapsing the answer to one course.** Several courses may follow this one; all of them
  are offered, in the order the script returns them.
- **Dropping the reason a course was suggested.** A suggestion the learner cannot check is
  a suggestion they cannot decline for a good reason.
- **Copying the finished workspace into a follow-up**, or treating `recommended_previous_bundles`
  as a statement about source code. Section 12.5.
- **Asking whether the earlier course was completed** before starting a follow-up. Section
  11.5, and it is the same refusal.
---

## 13. Validating the instance

The tutor never improvises around a broken bundle (section 9). That refusal is only worth
having if the runner finds the defect before a learner does, and the moment to find it is
materialization: the instance exists, no file has been placed outside `tutorial/`, and
nobody has started. `state-lifecycle.md` section 3.1 is the procedure — where in the
materialization sequence the run sits, what is recorded, and why. This section is the
policy: when the check runs afterwards, what each outcome means, and what the learner is
told.

### 13.1 When the validator runs, and when it does not

**A teaching turn does not run it.** Section 1 sets the cost of a resume — the manifest,
`STATE.md`, one lesson, no host contacted, nothing fetched — and a validator on every turn
breaks that rule to re-check a directory that almost never changes. The files the checks
read are the bundle's, and the bundle's copy in an instance is written once.

**Never re-checking is the opposite mistake**, because an instance whose files were edited
would never be looked at again. So the check runs at four further moments, each one a
moment where something changed or something is already wrong:

1. **The stamp carries no `validated` key.** The instance was materialized by a runner
   older than this check, or materialization stopped before reaching it. Validate before
   the first task of that session and record the outcome, exactly as at materialization.
2. **Materialization is being completed after an interruption** — the instance still holds
   `STATE.template.md`. The validation step is part of the sequence being completed, not an
   extra.
3. **A structural defect surfaces during teaching** — a lesson file the manifest lists and
   the instance does not have, a validator a lesson names and the manifest does not
   declare, a `design_refs` anchor that is not in `DESIGN.md`. Run the validator once and
   report the whole list. A defect rarely travels alone, and one run answers "what else is
   wrong in here" for no context at all.
4. **Somebody asks for it**, or the learner says they changed something inside `tutorial/`.

A `validated` key that is present is not re-checked on a resume. It records that the check
ran on the day it says; it is not a claim that nothing has changed since. Moment 3 is what
covers a changed instance, and it covers it at the point where the change actually matters.

### 13.2 The outcomes, and the one choice that is the learner's

`state-lifecycle.md` section 3.1 carries the outcome table. The policy in three lines:

- **A finding stops the course from starting.** The bundle is defective and the tutor does
  not teach from it.
- **A warning never stops anything.** The validator keeps warnings in a list the exit code
  cannot consult, precisely so a quality signal can never reject a bundle. Do not add that
  coupling back by counting them.
- **Indeterminate is not a pass.**

Exit 3 says the validator found nothing wrong **and could not certify that nothing is
wrong**. A `DESIGN.md` that is not valid UTF-8 reaches it that way: check 1 reports NOT
RUN, and no `design_refs` entry in the course was resolved at all. Calling that a pass is
exactly the false oracle the exit code exists to prevent — the check that would have seen
the defect is the check that did not run, so a green verdict built on it certifies nothing,
and the dangling anchor surfaces at lesson 7 as if no validator had ever existed.

So an indeterminate run does not start a course on the runner's own judgement. It is also
not a finding, and telling a learner their course is broken would be false. Stop before the
first task, report what did not run (13.3), and let the learner decide. When they choose to
start anyway:

- say in the same breath which checks are uncertified and what each one would have proved;
- record `validation: not-certified` with those check numbers in the stamp, and one line in
  `STATE.md` under *Known intentional or incomplete state* (`state-lifecycle.md` section
  3.1);
- start, and do not raise it again. A session that resumes an instance carrying that record
  does not re-ask a question the learner has already answered.

Never present an indeterminate run as "probably fine", and never let the checks that did
run stand in for the one that did not.

### 13.3 What the learner is told

A learner did not write the bundle and usually cannot repair it. "The course is broken"
gives them nothing to do; a pasted validator run gives them a check table, a limitations
essay and no sentence addressed to them. Five things, in this order:

1. **Which course, and where it came from.** The title and `id`, the `materialized_from`
   locator in the stamp, and the catalogue entry that offered it while discovery is still
   in hand. The catalogue is how they reach whoever can fix this.
2. **What the validator said, in its own words** — one line per finding: the check number,
   the file, the message. Do not paraphrase. The message names the anchor, the path or the
   field that is wrong, and that is the only part an author can act on. Do not include the
   check table, and do not include the limitations text printed after the verdict.
3. **That it is the bundle, not them.** The course as published is defective. Nothing in
   their workspace caused it, and nothing they write will fix it.
4. **What they can actually do**, offered as choices rather than instructions: take a
   different course — the candidates from discovery are still in hand and offering them
   costs no file open; tell whoever publishes this one, naming the catalogue and the source
   it resolved to; or, when the bundle is local and theirs, correct it **in the bundle** and
   start again. Correcting the instance is not on the list, and 13.5 says why.
5. **Where their workspace stands.** `tutorial/` exists and holds no progress, nothing was
   placed outside it, and it can be removed if they want it gone.

For an indeterminate run, items 2 and 3 change and the other three are identical: name the
checks that did not run with the reason the validator printed for each, say what those
checks would have proved, and say plainly that nothing was found wrong and nothing was
certified either. Then the choice in 13.2.

This is a report, not a lesson. The findings go in verbatim; everything else is a sentence.

### 13.4 A defect found while a course is already running

A running course is not the same situation as a course about to start, and the rule is not
the same. The learner has work in the workspace and a place in the course. Stopping that
protects nobody and loses both.

Report the finding as 13.3 describes, refuse to improvise around it exactly as section 9
requires, and go on teaching whatever the defect does not touch. A dangling `design_refs`
anchor costs one lesson its design reading; a lesson file that is missing costs that lesson.
Neither one costs the learner the lesson they are standing in, unless the finding names it.

When the defect does block the next step, say so plainly and say which repair unblocks it —
a corrected bundle and a fresh instance, or the author's next release. Then update the
stamp's validation record with the date and outcome of that run.

### 13.5 Failure modes to refuse

- **Teaching from an instance nobody validated.** Section 13.1.
- **Treating an indeterminate run as a pass**, or deciding on the learner's behalf to start
  on an uncertified course. Section 13.2.
- **Stopping a course over warnings**, or counting warnings until they add up to a failure.
  The exit code cannot see them, and neither should the decision.
- **Narrating warnings to a learner as defects.** They are addressed to the author, they
  name nothing the learner can act on, and reading them out at the start of a course is
  noise. Discarding them is the opposite mistake: the count is recorded and a re-run prints
  them verbatim. `state-lifecycle.md` section 3.1.
- **Paraphrasing a finding.** "Something is wrong with lesson 3" is not something an author
  can act on; `[check 1] lessons/03-first-refactor.md: design_refs names 'state-merge',
  which is not an anchor in DESIGN.md` is.
- **Repairing the instance so the finding goes away.** The course everyone else takes still
  has the defect, and this learner now takes a course nobody else is taking. Repairs belong
  in the bundle.
- **Reporting an exit 2 as a defect in the learner's course.** A usage or I/O error is the
  runner's own mistake; correct the invocation. When it persists, the course is uncertified
  and 13.2 applies.
- **Running the validator every turn.** Section 13.1, and the cost rule in section 1.
