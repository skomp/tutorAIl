"""Test suite for skills/tutorail/scripts/catalogs.py.

Run it with:  python3 tests/test_catalogs.py

No pytest, no PyYAML, and NO NETWORK. Nothing here contacts a host.

The point of this suite is not to show the script working. Every failure kind
gets a fixture that makes it fire, with a message a learner could act on, and
the meta-test at the end fails if any kind in catalogs.FAILURE_KINDS has no
fixture behind it. A kind that can only be shown passing is a false oracle,
and this script's whole job is to tell three failures apart.

How the git failures are produced, and why two ways:

  * REAL git, against a local repository over a file:// URL. That covers
    success, a missing catalogue file inside a real clone, and a ref that is
    really not there. It exercises clone, fetch, checkout and rev-parse for
    real, with no network.

  * A FAKE git on PATH, printing the stderr real git prints, exiting 128.
    That covers the failures a local repository cannot produce: an
    unreachable host, a refused credential, and a message the classifier has
    never seen. Each canned message is copied from what git actually prints,
    and the test asserts git's own words reach the report, so a fake that was
    never invoked cannot pass.

The trap this suite is built around: an SSH failure prints BOTH the transport
error AND "Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have
the correct access rights" - the same words a refused key prints. A
classifier that tests access first calls every unreachable host an access
problem. That case has its own test.
