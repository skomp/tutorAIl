"""Test suite for skills/tutorail/scripts/validate_bundle.py.

Run it with:  python3 tests/test_validate_bundle.py

No pytest. PyYAML may or may not be installed; it makes no difference,
because the scripts never use it (tutorAIl#29). The suite asserts that,
in test_yaml_reader_ignores_the_environment.

The point of this suite is NOT to show the validator passing. A validator that
can only be shown passing is a false oracle. Every check gets a deliberately
broken fixture and the suite asserts THAT SPECIFIC check fires with a message
the bundle's author could act on. The meta-test at the end fails if any check
in validate_bundle.CHECKS has no fixture that makes it fire.

Two traps this suite is built around:

  * The local filesystem is CASE-INSENSITIVE. Renaming LESSON.md to lesson.md
    is a no-op unless the old entry is removed first, so the mis-cased fixture
    verifies the directory listing rather than assuming the shell worked.

  * A reverse material check ("LESSON.md names a file that does not exist")
    was implemented and deleted upstream because it cannot tell a material
    reference from an ordinary prose mention. It must not come back, so there
    is no test for it.

Positive-fixture baselines are copies of real, known-good bundles. They are
never mutated in place: each case works on a fresh copy in a temp directory.

- Do not treat a partially complete refactor as finished.

# Catalogue mode, check 3: an entry field this document does not define
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Issue #18. A catalogue entry could carry ANY key and nothing reported it,
# so `optional_lesson_cnt: 3` validated clean, the runner never saw it, the
# course advertised no optional lessons, and no tool told anybody.
#
# It is part of check 3, which is already the question about an entry's
# fields, and not a check of its own. A catalogue check that could only ever
# warn would be a number in the table that can never change the verdict, and
# `test_catalogs.test_catalog_check_coverage` requires every number there to
# be demonstrated producing a FINDING - a real oracle worth not weakening.
# Bundle check 23 is the precedent for one check doing both: shape errors as
# findings, alias collisions as warnings.
#
# The report WARNS and never rejects, and that is the part worth defending.
# bundle-format.md section 13 settled the shape for bundles: a newer writer
# may add a key and an OLDER reader degrades rather than refusing. A
# catalogue is the same argument - it is data a newer runner may extend - so
# a validator that rejected an unrecognised key would turn a valid catalogue
# into an unusable one the day the format grows.
#
# The second constraint comes from the issue's comment, and it is the reason
# these cases are written against PARSED KEYS. A generated catalogue's header
# comment names `optional_lesson_count`, so `grep -c optional_lesson_count`
# counts (entries carrying the field) + 1. That equals the entry count
# EXACTLY when precisely one entry is missing the field - the single case
# such a check exists to catch is the single case it passes.

# The phrase every unrecognised-field report opens with. Shared between the
# assertions rather than retyped, so a reworded message cannot leave a test
# searching for a string nothing produces and passing on the empty result.
